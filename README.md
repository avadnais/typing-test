# [Typing Test](https://avadnais.github.io/typing-test/)

## A 30 second challenge of your typing skills! 
The timer starts when you start typing. The text prompt is automatically updated on every <spacebar> press to show whether the last word was correct or not. 
Words per minute (WPM) is calculated using the total characters typed divided by 5 (characters per "word"), then doubled to account for the time being only 30 seconds.
Accuracy is calculated by dividing the correctly typed words by the total number of words typed.
Net words per minute (Net WPM) is calculated by multiplying WPM * Accuracy.
